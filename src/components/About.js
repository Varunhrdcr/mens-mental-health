                Our mission is to support men's mental health through community engagement and accessible resources.
                We believe that mental health is just as important as physical health, and we strive to create a safe space for men to express themselves.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Raise awareness about men's mental health issues.</li>
                <li>Provide resources and support networks.</li>
                <li>Encourage open conversations about mental wellness.</li>
